## Day 1: Tableau Data Visualization 🎨

### Task 1: Comparative Analysis of Tableau Versions 🔍
In this task, I explored different versions of Tableau to identify the best tool for various project needs. Highlights include:

- **Tableau Desktop:**  
  - Designed for creating and analyzing data visualizations.  
  - Offers full access to data connectors and advanced analytics capabilities.  
  - Enables dashboard creation for sharing via Tableau Server or Tableau Online.

- **Tableau Server & Tableau Online:**  
  - Facilitates sharing and collaboration on dashboards.  
  - Provides centralized management with robust security features.  
  - Tableau Online operates in the cloud, eliminating the need for on-premises installations.

- **Tableau Prep:**  
  - Focuses on data preparation and cleansing prior to analysis.  
  - Offers a visual interface that simplifies the combination and transformation of multiple data sources.

- **Tableau Public:**  
  - A free version designed for public sharing of visualizations.  
  - Limitations include restricted data source connections, public data exposure, local save restrictions, and a row cap.

This analysis ensures informed decisions on software selection based on project requirements. 🔎

### Task 2: EMSI_JobChange_UK Dashboard 📈
This task involved creating a comprehensive dashboard using the EMSI_JobChange_UK dataset to uncover job market trends:

- **Visualization Features:**  
  - A **bar chart** displaying the percentage change in job dynamics.  
  - A **UK map** highlighting key city locations affected by job changes.

These visual insights provide a quick overview of regional employment trends and help identify areas needing further analysis. 🌍

## Day 2: Data Analytics 🔢

### Task 1: Spotify Trends Analysis 🎵
Analyzing the Spotify dataset revealed several trends:

- **High Tempo Across Genres:**  
  - Most genres maintain a tempo greater than 100 BPM, with an inverse relation between energy levels and instrumental-ness.

- **Consistent Genre Patterns:**  
  - The top genres show uniformity in musical key patterns, unlike the more varied less popular ones.

- **Popularity & Musical Attributes:**  
  - Increasing danceability and energy correlate with higher popularity, whereas songs with moderate acoustic levels tend to be more engaging.

- **Song Duration:**  
  - While most tracks are around four minutes long, there are notable outliers on both ends.

These insights aid in understanding musical trends, which can be crucial for predictive analysis and strategic planning in the music industry. 🎶

### Task 2: Health Data Trends & NHS Recommendations 🏥
This analysis focused on health data to derive actionable insights for the NHS:

- **Life Expectancy Variations:**  
  - The global average is around 70 years, while Africa averages closer to 50 years.  
  - *Insight:* Collaborative international strategies may help address these disparities.

- **Population Growth Patterns:**  
  - Europe's population trends illustrate periods of decline followed by growth, requiring flexible healthcare services especially for aging populations.

- **Gradual Increases in Life Expectancy:**  
  - Over the past 20 years, improvements have been slow but steady, suggesting the benefit of continued data analytics.

- **Cancer Statistics:**  
  - Certain countries, such as China, show higher rates for some cancer types, with distinct patterns observed in the USA and Japan.  
  - *Insight:* Ongoing research into environmental and lifestyle factors is needed.

- **Metric Correlations:**  
  - Minimal correlation between BMI, cholesterol, or blood pressure and some cancers points to the complexity of health determinants.

These findings can assist in formulating targeted public health initiatives and healthcare reforms. 📊

## Day 3: Power BI Data Loading Labs 💻

### Lab 1: Get Data in Power BI Desktop 🔗
This lab focuses on importing data efficiently:

- Setting up connections to multiple data sources.
- Understanding data structures to facilitate subsequent analysis.
- Documenting the successful data import process with visuals.

### Lab 2: Load Transformed Data in Power BI Desktop 🔄
Building on the data import, this lab covers data transformation:

- Cleaning and shaping raw data after import.
- Loading the refined data into Power BI for enhanced visualization.
- Providing screenshots that document the transformation workflow.

## Day 4: Power BI Dashboard Design 🖥

### Lab 7: Design a Report in Power BI Desktop ✏️
In this lab, I developed aesthetically pleasing and functional reports:

- Integrating various types of visualizations to convey a clear narrative.
- Arranging the report layout to facilitate quick insights and data-driven decisions.
- Including visual documentation of the design process.

### Lab 10: Create a Power BI Dashboard 🌐
This final task synthesizes previous work into a single interactive dashboard:

- Integrates multiple visual elements into a cohesive display.
- Offers real-time data exploration and actionable insights.
- Supported by visuals that illustrate the dashboard’s creation steps.

## Course Notes 📚
Throughout the course, detailed notes were maintained to support each task:

- Comprehensive resources and revision guides.
- Supplementary insights for deeper understanding.
- Continuous updates alongside practical work.
